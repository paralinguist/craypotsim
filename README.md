Simulates a simple version of the Cray Fishing Game

The simple version of the Cray Fishing Game this is based on has rules as per the comments inside the main file.
It is a relatively basic lesson in probability.
More complex versions exist (example: http://www.mathxtc.com/Games/Games.html), which shouldn't be too difficult to implement by modifying this sim.

The sim is designed to make it easy to try different strategies for pot placement - some are provided.

If using with a class (of students) it's probably best to only include 2 initial strategies and then teach students how to add their own.

It should become clear pretty early on that the sim is geared toward rewarding high risk strategies - so the sim is also designed to allow the rules and parameters to be easily changed as well.
